Welcome to a city that'll bring you to your knees
It'll make you beg for more until you can't even breathe
Your blindfold is on tight, but you like what you see
So follow me into the night 'cause I got just what you need
We're all rolling down the boulevard full of pimps and sharks
It's a motherfucking riot we've been dying to start
You better grab a hold 'cause now you know you're falling apart
You thought these streets were paved in gold, but they're dirty and dark
Been to hell, I can show you the devil
Down you fell, can't hold yourself together
Soul to sell, down here you live forever
Welcome to a world where dreams become nightmares
Been to hell, I can show you the devil
Down you fell, can't hold yourself together
Soul to sell, down here you live forever
Welcome to a world where dreams become nightmares
Welcome
Welcome
