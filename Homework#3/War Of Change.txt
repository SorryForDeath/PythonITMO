It's a truth that in love and war
Worlds collide and hearts get broken
I wanna live like I know I'm dying
Take up my cross, not be afraid
Is it true what they say, that words are weapons?
And if it is, then everybody best stop stepping
'Cause I got ten in my pocket that'll bend ya locket
I'm tired of all these rockers saying, "Come with me"
Wait, it's just about to break, it's more than I can take
Everything's about to change
I feel it in my veins, it's not going away
Everything's about to change
It creeps in like a thief in the night
Without a sign, without a warning
But we are ready and prepared to fight
Raise up your swords, don't be afraid
Is it true what they say, that words are weapons?
And if it is, then everybody best stop stepping
'Cause I got ten in my pocket that'll bend ya locket
I'm tired of all these rockers saying, "Come with me"
