Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we, mistaken?
But you see, it's not me, it's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are cryin'
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, ohWelcome to a city that'll bring you to your knees
It'll make you beg for more until you can't even breathe
Your blindfold is on tight, but you like what you see
So follow me into the night 'cause I got just what you need
We're all rolling down the boulevard full of pimps and sharks
It's a motherfucking riot we've been dying to start
You better grab a hold 'cause now you know you're falling apart
You thought these streets were paved in gold, but they're dirty and dark
Been to hell, I can show you the devil
Down you fell, can't hold yourself together
Soul to sell, down here you live forever
Welcome to a world where dreams become nightmares
Been to hell, I can show you the devil
Down you fell, can't hold yourself together
Soul to sell, down here you live forever
Welcome to a world where dreams become nightmares
Welcome
WelcomeIt's a truth that in love and war
Worlds collide and hearts get broken
I wanna live like I know I'm dying
Take up my cross, not be afraid
Is it true what they say, that words are weapons?
And if it is, then everybody best stop stepping
'Cause I got ten in my pocket that'll bend ya locket
I'm tired of all these rockers saying, "Come with me"
Wait, it's just about to break, it's more than I can take
Everything's about to change
I feel it in my veins, it's not going away
Everything's about to change
It creeps in like a thief in the night
Without a sign, without a warning
But we are ready and prepared to fight
Raise up your swords, don't be afraid
Is it true what they say, that words are weapons?
And if it is, then everybody best stop stepping
'Cause I got ten in my pocket that'll bend ya locket
I'm tired of all these rockers saying, "Come with me"
